# Requirements

Make a mini-simulator for a group stage consisting of 4 teams.

Code is readable, written in English, well structured and commented.

Make sure that your code is testable, extensible and maintainable, not only for yourself but also for others to understand.

Keep in mind the SOLID principles.

Of course, it is also important that the functioning of the end result matches the specs.

Create a new ASP.NET Core 8.0 website.

Simulate the matches and results of a group of 4 teams. There are three rounds, so six matches in total.

Keep in mind that each team has its own strength (which players play in the team, who scores, etc. is not so important in this assignment). We want to see this reflected in the final score (if we simulate the group very often, the better teams more often finish above the worse teams).

You can make the "match simulation" as simple or extensive as you want. Tip: we mainly care about the results and the group standings.

The graphical end result is at least the position of the group and what the mutual results were. Important: at the end we should be able to see which teams advance to the knockout stage, remember the sorting:
1 Points
2 Goal difference
3 Goals for
4 Goals against
5 Head 2 head result

We value a good technical implementation of the UI, where the platform specific standards are met.

Show what you have in the field of .NET and concentrate on the simulation and not on the graphical end result.

Have good architecture, maintainability, extensibility and testability.
